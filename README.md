## Target Locker

Target Locker helps you capture tomorrow’s commitments, lock them in, and receive browser nudges when it’s time to follow through.

### Features
- Lock targets for the next day with context notes and a reminder time
- Automatic countdowns so you always know what’s coming up next
- Browser notifications (when supported and enabled) to keep you accountable
- Targets persist locally in `localStorage`, so your list stays private
- Relock completed wins to roll successful routines into the next day

### Local Development

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to use the app.

> Keep the tab open if you want scheduled reminders to fire on time—notifications are handled by the browser.
